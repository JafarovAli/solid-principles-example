# SOLID Principles in C# - Practical Examples

This repository contains 5 separate C# projects that demonstrate each of the **SOLID principles** in software design. Each project is focused on a single principle with a simple, clear, and easy-to-understand implementation using real-world inspired scenarios.

## 📚 What is SOLID?

**SOLID** is an acronym that represents five key design principles for writing maintainable, scalable, and robust object-oriented software:

1. **S** – Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
2. **O** – Open/Closed Principle (OCP)
3. **L** – Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)
4. **I** – Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)
5. **D** – Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)

## 📂 Projects Structure

Each principle has its own folder with a dedicated C# console application and a short explanation in comments.

### ✅ 1. Single Responsibility Principle (`SRP`)

**Each class should have only one reason to change.**


---

### ✅ 2. Open/Closed Principle (`OCP`)

**Software entities should be open for extension, but closed for modification.**


---

### ✅ 3. Liskov Substitution Principle (`LSP`)

**Subtypes must be substitutable for their base types without breaking the application.**


---

### ✅ 4. Interface Segregation Principle (`ISP`)

**Clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they do not use.**


---

### ✅ 5. Dependency Inversion Principle (`DIP`)

**High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules; both should depend on abstractions.**

## ▶️ Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/JafarovAli/solid-principles-example.git
   ```
2. Open the solution in **Visual Studio** or **Rider**.
3. Build and run each project individually from its own folder.
